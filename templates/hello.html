<h1>Welcome to Longturn</h1>
<p>
You are here, because you enjoy Civilization-like games, and wish to
play a multiplayer game with 20-30 human players, across a couple of
months. You should get started by reading the <a href="{% url 'intro' %}">introduction</a>
and <a href="{% url 'rules' %}">rules</a>.
If you like what you see, <a href="{% url 'register' %}">create and account</a> and sign on to a game.
If you're lucky, an experimental game is running and you can be spawned right away!
</p>
